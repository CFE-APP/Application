# What is CFE?

In Iran, we experience power outages almost dailyâ€”about 2 hours each day.
This has been a serious problem for programmers, graphic designers, gamers, and othersâ€”especially if they haven't saved their projects!

Thatâ€™s where my idea comes in:
**CFE** is a timer-based tool designed to help you deal with sudden power cuts.

It can:

* Alert you a few minutes before a planned power outage.
* Automatically enable **Hibernate mode** so your data is safe and your system can boot back up instantly when the power is restored.

This tool is especially useful for people who run long renders or train complex AI models overnight.

2. CFE **must always be running** in the background to work properly.
3. You need to **add your power outage schedule** in the **Alarms** section.
4. CFE currently does **not support a portable version**.
   If you want to make it portable, youâ€™ll need to tweak the `npm` config files and compile it yourself.
